## 👋 Hey there, I'm @4rdii

I'm a blockchain and security expert driven by curiosity, precision, and a deep passion for decentralized technology.  
Over the years, I’ve worked across multiple blockchain ecosystems — designing, developing, and securing smart contracts that power DeFi, bridges, and on-chain systems.  

I believe in **clarity, security, and simplicity** in code — and I love transforming complex ideas into efficient, verifiable smart contracts.

### 🧠 What I Work With

I enjoy exploring the full spectrum of blockchain development, from low-level optimization to high-level protocol architecture.

**Languages & Frameworks:**
- Solidity  
- Rust / Anchor  
- Yul  
- Huff  
- Vyper  
- Python  
- C++  
- MATLAB  
- R  

**Focus Areas:**
- Smart Contract Security & Auditing  
- Formal Verification / Symbolic Execution (Certora Prover)  
- DeFi Protocol & Tokenomics Design  
- Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZK-SNARKs, ZK Circuits)

### 💡 Projects

A few things I’ve built and contributed to:

- 🎨 **[Salwa Design](https://salwadesign.com/?lang=ar)** – String art image processing algorithm and voice/animation generator  
- 📊 **[Instagram Analysis](https://github.com/4rdii/instagram-message-analysis)** – Instagram customer message analytics for marketing insights  
- 🔗 **[Real-world Tokenized Assets](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/rwa-creator)** – Stock on-chain price API and tokenized asset framework using Chainlink Functions

### 🤝 Collaboration

I’m always open to collaborating on challenging blockchain projects — whether that means designing protocols, reviewing smart contracts, or developing new DeFi primitives.  
If your goal is to **push the limits of decentralized systems**, we’ll probably get along well.
